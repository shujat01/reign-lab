      title: 'Integrative Multi-Omics Approaches to Map Adaptive and Maladaptive Biological Signatures at High Altitude',
      fullDescription: `High-altitude environments serve as a natural laboratory for studying physiological and pathophysiological responses to hypobaric hypoxia. As oxygen is fundamental to cellular and systemic homeostasis, sustained hypoxic exposure can lead to significant physiological disruptions and health challenges. Our lab's integrative multi-omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, targeted proteomics, and global DNA methylation analysis, deepen the understanding of hypobaric hypoxia implications in health and disease. These insights have significant inferences for deciphering hypoxia-driven responses in the pathogenesis of major diseases where hypoxia plays a critical role.`,

      title: 'this is temporary',
      fullDescription: `There is a growing recognition that intermittent hypoxia can be beneficial by enhancing cardiopulmonary health and improving overall oxygenation capacity. However, translational aspects of these findings pose challenges as the cellular responses to hypoxia involve complex signaling pathways. Animal models have played a key role in understanding the beneficial effects of intermittent hypoxic exposure in complications, such as stroke and cardiorespiratory disorders, that can be extrapolated to humans; however, the protocol for this approach needs to be properly standardized before being implemented in human subjects. Our laboratory attempts to standardize protocols in murine models receiving such therapeutic hypoxic exposures that can further their clinical application in normobaric hypoxic disorders.`,

      title: 'Decoding the Genetics of Cardiovascular Diseases: From Discovery to Beyond',
      fullDescription: `Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a leading cause of mortality, with sudden cardiac death (SCD) affecting even young, seemingly healthy individuals. Many SCD cases arise from Cardiac Channelopathies, where genetic mutations, inherited or de novo, disrupt the heart rhythm. Our lab focuses on the identification of a significant number of variants that are unique to the Indian population by establishing genotype-phenotype correlations. Our ultimate goal is to transform genetic insights into actionable strategies, paving the way for early diagnosis, targeted therapies, and the prevention of sudden cardiac death in at-risk individuals.`,
